# MERN To-Do App

This app has been created with the intentions to show my skills in the following technologies:

- Mongo DB to store and persist all the data.
- Express as Node's framework to create the API as well as othe functionalities.
- React for an excelent UI/UX 
- Node JS for running the backend services.

The database is hosted in Mongo Atlas as it offers a free tier for non-productive apps as in this case.

I am currently looking for a Cloud provider to host my NodeJS app so it can be public access.
